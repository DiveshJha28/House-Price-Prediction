# House-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on the predicting the housing price of the data sets based on the available features. I have used the visualization tools to draw the graph and find the co-relations among the variables. Linear Regressions of Machine Learning Algorithms was used to develop the models. The model accuracy was near to 70%.
